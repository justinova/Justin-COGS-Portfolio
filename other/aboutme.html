      <p class = "col-9" style="margin-top:50px">My name is Justin and I am a student in the 2-year Geographic Sciences program at Centre of Geographic Sciences(COGS)
        in Nova Scotia, Canada. Before coming to Canada, I have been a English Language Teaching (ELT) and educational technology consultant for over
        10 years in Seoul, South Korea with a MA in TESOL(Teaching English to Students in Other Languages) from Sungkyungwan University. Also, I have
        a BA in Economics from Korea University and have worked in various Korean companies, notably CJ Entertainment, a large entertainment firm based
        in South Korea. I am also a Google Certified Trainer and a member of Google Earth Education Community, having trained numerous Koreans and
        Canadians to the world of Google by training them how to use Google docs, slides, sheets and YouTube to enhance their teaching experience.
        My first exposure in GIS and mapping was during my time in the military when I had the opportunity to work alongside U.S. Army terrain analysts.
        However, it is my recent experience with Google Earth and Google Maps that led me to pursue a career in GIS and beyond. I am also passionate
        about sharing knowledge and helping other, which prompt me to become an International Student Ambassador for COGS. During my free time, I enjoy
        listening to good music, mostly classical music and  jazz. </p>
